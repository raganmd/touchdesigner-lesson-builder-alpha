## [ipar](#1)  
Here I'm using internal parameters to controll this scene. Internal parameters act a bit like private variables. They're easily accessible inside of the of the component, and also have the convienence behaviors of extensions 

## [Starting Positions](#2)  
Starting with SOPs we can define a seed position and relatinoship between our particles and their trails.

## [Trail Position](#3)  
Trails evolve over time through the use of feedback and transformation.

## [Position as Texture](#4)  
Position is represetned as floating point textures to be used in the shader pipeline.

## [Particle Color](#5)  
Particle and trail color is defiend by these ramps.

## [Particle Heads](#6)  
To create a convincing shape we use a sphere to define the particle head position.

## [Traliling Elements](#7)  
The trailing cone shape can be found here.

## [Render](#8)  
All 3D elements are rendered here.
